GameMenuProfileMediaPersistFramework
====================================

The JavaScript code in this repository implements a menu, profile, media, and persistence framework around an extremely rudimentary video game.  To see it in action, open the file _Program.html in a web browser that runs JavaScript.  

Four homemade media files are (somewhat inappropriately) included with the source code for testing purposes.
